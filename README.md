### Hi there üëã
Halo Tanuki Here! a common Rakun with some basic ~~WEEB~~ programing skills
i Like gaming of course, have some IRL friends, but don't have IRL waifu :(
maybe some of you laughing right now , ya whatever.. do what you want so do i ‚îê(Ô∏∂‚ñΩÔ∏∂)‚îå

Anyway~ back in 2009 i just have first symbian phone, it's Nokia 6630 a s60v2 OS.  
basically I learned the first Programming Language on that phone, yes it was ~~HTML~~ PHP because I turned out to be a blogger at that time.  
No it's not blogspot, not xtgem, not wordpress, it's a Mywapblog (MWB) if you are curious you can still visit `sicheater.heck.in` with wayback machine.  
After that i found pys60 wooo!! this change my life forever, i still remember Agus Ibrahim and GulamGumalGamul they made own game with Python for symbian (also called PyS60) but for me they are elders (sesepuh :v) they make tutorial from pys60v2 to s60v5 even made a fb group..i learned python alot from they. jasamu selalu ku kenang :) Thanks you!.  
then 2014 maybe? i forgor.. i got my first PC a atom celeron procesor ddr2 2gb with GTX4xx i forgorrrr , it's can play crisis? NO! thats why i found sandbox.yoyogames.com its something like itch.io but only for gamemaker. its small engine, the language similar to python, i instantly love it!.  
i made tiny software like keygen on gamemaker 8, but is just something like readme software, when you open it's just play 8bit music and display my name on it LMAO üòÜ
i copy that software into my friends flashdisk then make it autorun haha..

Actually there are still many stories that I want to tell, but I think this is enough to tell how I started as a programmer.
Thanks you for reading.
